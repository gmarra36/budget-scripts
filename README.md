# README

I had some custom budget reports I wanted, so I wrote some scripts
that I thought would help. I wanted to publish these to see
what people thought of them!

This Repo uses PHP 8.0.*

# budget_vars.php File

Place budget_vars.php in ~/Documents
Insert appropiate keys and variables into this file

# budget_flags.php File

This is used, if you use flags in budget
Copy the file to ~/Documents
And name each color flag the appropiate name

Comment out unused flag colors

IE I use purple for Camera gear, but it will
come out of different budgets, so they all
get "flagged" purple 

# Where to put THIS directory
